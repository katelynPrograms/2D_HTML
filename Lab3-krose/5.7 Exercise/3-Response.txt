The loading gif is no longer displayed when canvas, chrome, and toast are changed to block. This because they are being displayed first, on top of other layers, and therefore
they are not allowing the gif to be shown. The bottom display bar with the controls are blocked, so the player doesn't know how to move. 

SIDE NOTE: I do hope we fix the keyboard inputs in a later exercise.
