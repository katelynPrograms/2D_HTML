Once again, the CSS isn't working. I went into CSS, HTML, and JS and edited a lot of things. I
thought the edits would fix it but nothing changed. As for the question, I did not get to observe
the cycle changes. I assume there would be little to none negative consequences for using flyweight.
The use of flyweight in programming is to reduce memory usage and have object oriented programming
be more flexible in using and testing.
