I went into the JavaScript and did a "find and replace" task. I replaced "this." with "snailBait." in each find. When I go to run the code, the window is displayed. However,
snailbait the game is not. The code already understands where to pull from when using "this." and when using "snailBait." it gets the parameters from one place.
