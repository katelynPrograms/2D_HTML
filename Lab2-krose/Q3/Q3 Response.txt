The new background image does not fit the canvas. Because of this, the animation we have set to make the background continuously move, thus making the player progress forward,
is very much visible and doesn't give the player our desired experience. The discontinuity is obvious as the animation progresses. In order to make this image work, we'd 
either have to scale the image up, or scale the canvas, runner, and platforms down to fit.
